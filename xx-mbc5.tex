\chapter{MBC5 mapper chip}

The majority of games for Game Boy Color use the MBC5 chip. MBC5 supports ROM
sizes up to 64 Mbit (512 banks of \hex{4000} bytes), and RAM sizes up to 1 Mbit
(16 banks of \hex{2000} bytes). The information in this section is based on my
MBC5 research, and The Cycle-Accurate Game Boy Docs \cite{tcagbd}.
