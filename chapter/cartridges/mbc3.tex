\chapter{MBC3 mapper chip}

MBC3 supports ROM sizes up to 32 Mbit (256 banks of \hex{4000} bytes), and RAM
sizes up to 256 Kbit (4 banks of \hex{2000} bytes). It also includes a
real-time clock (RTC) that can be clocked with a quartz crystal on the
cartridge even when the Game Boy is powered down. The information in this
section is based on my MBC3 research, and Pan Docs \cite{pandocs}.

\begin{warning}
  The largest known official game release with MBC3 has only a 16 Mbit ROM
  chip. This is why most documentation, including Pan Docs \cite{pandocs},
  claims that MBC3 only supports up to 16 Mbit. However, this is technically
  incorrect since the chip can handle a 32 Mbit ROM.
